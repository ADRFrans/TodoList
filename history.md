# Learning History

This file is maintained by the assistant to track your progress so we can resume quickly.

## Session protocol

- When asked "Where did we leave off" or "next steps", read both `history.md` and `LearningPlan.md` first.
- Response format: short description of the last session completed, then next steps.
- I will update history.md and LearningPlan.md during the session (as needed) and at the end of each session without prompting.
- At logical checkpoints, I will prompt you to update your git repo (status/add/commit, and push if desired).
## Current status

- Date: 2025-12-23
- Current milestone: Milestone 2 (State and events)
- What you worked on: Added `useState`, input, add button, and handler to append todos.
- What felt easy:
- What felt confusing: Handling empty input and where to place `handleAdd`.
- Next step: Add a label/placeholder and toggle completion with checkbox clicks.
