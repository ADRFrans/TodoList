# TodoList - React Learning Project

This repo is my hands-on React learning space. I'm using Codex as a mentor to guide me (without writing my app code), with a learning plan and a running history log to track progress and stumbling blocks.

## What this is

- A beginner-to-intermediate React journey
- A Todo app that grows over time
- A structured learning plan and history log

## Key files

- `LearningPlan.md`: the step-by-step roadmap and milestones
- `history.md`: session log of what I worked on, what was confusing, and next steps

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- This project is intentionally built incrementally.
- The goal is to ship a polished version to GitHub when finished.
